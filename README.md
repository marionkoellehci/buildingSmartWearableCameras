# Building Smart Wearable Cameras

This repository contains a template for building smart cameras that could be worn on the body or placed around the house. Assembly instructions are available from the accompanying [wiki](https://github.com/marionkoellehci/buildingSmartWearableCameras/wiki). There is also some python modules available to try out different types of smart cameras. The core idea, however, is to provide a starting point for experimenting.
